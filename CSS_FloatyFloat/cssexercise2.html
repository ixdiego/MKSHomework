		I CAN'T QUITE PUT THE WORD "NAVIGATION" INSIDE THE DIV WITH class="navigation". I think the text for "Logo" is located where it is in relation to the ehader being "position: absolute" but I'm not sure. Thoughts?

		<p>
 			navigation
 		</p> -->
 		<!-- if you put the word navigation here, it's outside of the .navigation div. in addition, .header1 isn't absolutely positioned, .header2 is. but you shouldn't absolutely position it anywayâ€”you don't want it to be not move, do you? if you are trying to get it to contain the logo/nav, you'll need a clearfix.. we'll go over that today in class ;)  -->
